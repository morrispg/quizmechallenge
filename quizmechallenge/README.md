This assignment presented opportunities to work with Arrays, Objects, Timers, Local Storage, Event Listeners, Intervals, Functions and more! There are many moving parts to this simple website. Getting them all to interact and present to the user is a challenge. I look forward to optimizing certain parts of this assignment in the future. In this project I used pieces of code from my instructor, tutors, and w3school.com
